Code Features

    AI Capabilities:
        Sentiment Analysis: Leverages Hugging Face's pipeline for analyzing the tone of social media posts.
        Topic Modeling: Uses TF-IDF vectorization and KMeans clustering to identify themes in text data.
        Content Generation: Utilizes GPT-2 to generate marketing content.

    Data Preprocessing:
        Cleans social media posts (removes URLs, hashtags, mentions).
        Converts text into lowercase and removes special characters.

    Visualization:
        Sentiment distribution using seaborn.
        Topic clusters visualized as histograms.

    Scalability:
        Processes large volumes of data with efficient clustering and vectorization.

    Integration:
        Results saved as a JSON file for easy integration into dashboards or reports.

How to Expand

    Data Source Integration:
        Add APIs to fetch live social media data (e.g., Twitter API, Facebook Graph API).

    Advanced NLP Models:
        Use OpenAI’s GPT-4 for more nuanced content generation and analysis.

    Optimization:
        Fine-tune GPT models for specific client industries (e.g., retail, tech).

    Backend Integration:
        Integrate with Flask/Django for web application development.
        Use a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing and querying insights.

    Dashboard:
        Add a front-end dashboard using frameworks like React or Vue.js for visualization.
